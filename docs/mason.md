Mason is mason as a web app: it holds the bricks together. People sign in with their own GitHub and GitLab accounts and get every
CLI and TUI view in a terminal-style browser UI: repos, pull requests, runs, approvals, releases, packages,
issues, security alerts, doctor/fix/sync, workflow hardening, stats, a defaults editor, a `mason` console,
plugins and a plugin marketplace.
The same API serves `mason` and `mason tui` on a laptop: `mason login https://mason` and they need neither gh
nor a GitHub token.

```

On a phone (below 700px; it can be added to the home screen), Mason is one column. The bar at the bottom has
repos, PRs, issues and runs, and **more** opens a menu of every view, the theme, dry run and sign out. Lists are
cards; tapping one opens its detail with the view's actions at the bottom, and back (the ‹ or the phone's own back
gesture) returns to the list:

## The web UI

The tabs are repos, pull requests, issues, runs, approvals, releases, packages, security, checks, workflows,
stats, defaults, console, plugins, market, settings and audit, plus tabs that plugins add. Each has a
one-key shortcut (`1` to `9` for the first ones, `I` issues, `W` workflows, `D` defaults, `:` console,
`P` plugins, `K` market, `S` settings, `L` audit).

- **Enter opens a page.** On repos it opens the repo's own page: its whole detail on the right and what
  you can do with it on the left (check, fix, sync, merge, create a release, its releases), with the output
  below. On releases it opens the repo's releases: every recent release on the left, the picked one in full
  (notes, assets, the runs of its tag) on the right. Pull requests, issues and runs have their own pages
  too (Enter, or **p** on the list): a PR's page merges, auto-merges, marks ready and shows the diff; an
  issue's page comments, closes and reopens; a run's page lists every job and step with its time and runs
  the failed jobs again (**R**). `Esc` goes back.
- **An event log runs full width along the bottom** of the lists (repos, pull requests, issues, runs,
  releases: about the selected row) and of every detail page. It folds away with ▾ and stays folded. It shows
  what happened to the repo, PR, issue, release or run on
  GitHub or GitLab (commits, reviews, comments, labels, ready, auto-merge, merges, checks, runs, tags,
  releases, assets), with your own changes from the audit log marked *yours*, newest first. A row with more
  text opens on a click. It asks again every 30s, and every few seconds after a change, so a merge, a ready
  or a release shows up on its own; a PR's state flips at once in the list and on its page.
- **A repo's page checks it against the defaults** when it opens (doctor, nothing changes): the drift shows
  under the actions, and its open PRs link to their pages.
- **The bottom line is the session log:** click it (or press `` ` ``) for every line of this session, and a
  change's whole output on a click.
- **Releases** creates releases: **n** opens a form with the tag (the next patch is suggested on a repo's
  release page), title, notes, target branch, draft, pre-release, and notes GitHub writes from the merged
  PRs. GitLab projects get the same form without draft and pre-release, which GitLab doesn't have.
  **T** (new tag) pushes only the tag, for repos whose workflow creates the release on a tag push (hubra's,
  with immutable releases); the release form warns when it finds such a workflow. A tag never changes the
  version file: when the group names one, the tag must be `v<version>`.
- **Bump and release** (`mason bump`, `mason release`) are on a repo's page and its releases page too: the
  version file against the latest release, **b** opens the bump PR (version and changelog), **R** pushes
  `v<version>` once it is merged.
- **Caching:** a tab you go back to shows its last answer at once and asks again after a minute; `r` and
  every change ask again right away.
- **Issues** lists issues across GitHub repos and GitLab projects, filtered by state, label, mine and age.
  It closes, reopens and comments on them, and **n** opens a new issue in any repo.
- **Workflows** shows what `mason workflows` finds; **p** opens a PR that pins the selected repo's actions
  to commit SHAs.
- **Settings** holds the defaults repo, orgs, extra and left-out repos, GitLab groups and projects,
  connected accounts, API keys, sessions and plugin secrets.
- **Keys:** arrows or `j`/`k` move, Enter acts, `/` filters, `r` reloads, `t` switches the theme
  (bricks, dark, or mortar, light) and saves your choice to your account, so every browser you sign in
  with uses it; `?` lists the keys.

## Run it

Mason needs the `server` extra and the built UI. Installing the package (a wheel or sdist build, as
`pipx install "mason-cli[tui,server] @ git+https://github.com/bitsandbricks-ch/mason-cli"` does)
builds the UI from `web/` into it with `npm ci && npm run build`, so have Node.js (`npm`) on your PATH.
Without npm the install still works, but `mason serve` prints how to build the UI and the browser gets
only that message. `mason serve --check` shows whether the UI is built. `MASON_SKIP_WEB_BUILD=1`
skips the build. An editable install (`pip install -e`) never builds it, so from a clone:

```sh
pip install -e ".[server]"                   # flask, sqlalchemy, cryptography, gunicorn
(cd web && npm ci && npm run build)          # the UI, into src/mason/server/static
mason serve --check                            # what the settings allow, and what is missing
mason serve --users                            # the accounts on this Mason (reads the database)
mason operator add github:you                  # after signing in once: the operator page
mason serve                                    # http://localhost:8080 (Flask's development server)
mason serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000         # somewhere else
```

`--port` sets the port Mason listens on (default 8080). Without `MASON_URL`, Mason's URL follows it, so
`mason serve --port 9000` is `http://localhost:9000`. Set `MASON_URL` yourself when people reach Mason any
other way, and keep its port the same as in the OAuth apps' callback URLs
(`{MASON_URL}/api/v1/auth/{github|gitlab}/callback`): a GitHub or GitLab app registered for
`http://localhost:8080/...` won't send you back to `:9000`.

UI development: `cd web && npm run dev` serves the UI on :5173 and passes `/api` to Mason on :8080.

## Run it with Docker

CI (`.github/workflows/image.yml`) publishes the image to GitHub Container Registry:

| tag | from |
| --- | --- |
| `ghcr.io/bitsandbricks-ch/mason-cli:main` | every push to `main` |
| `:1.2.3`, `:1.2`, `:latest` | a `v1.2.3` tag |
| `:sha-<commit>` | every build |

`deploy/docker-compose.yml` runs it with Postgres, taking its settings from `deploy/.env`:

```sh
cd deploy
cp .env.example .env        # MASON_URL, the OAuth apps, POSTGRES_PASSWORD (and MASON_TAG)
docker compose run --rm mason mason serve --check   # what the settings allow, and what is missing
docker compose up -d        # Mason on 127.0.0.1:8080, data in the `data` and `db` volumes
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d        # update to the newest image of MASON_TAG
```

Put a TLS proxy (Caddy, Traefik, nginx) in front that serves `MASON_URL` and forwards to `127.0.0.1:8080`;
compose sets `MASON_TRUSTED_PROXIES=1` so Mason sees the real client address. Without `MASON_ALLOW_*` anyone
with a GitHub or GitLab account can sign in and sees only their own repos and keys. The image is
private until you make the package public in its GitHub settings (or `docker login ghcr.io` first).
To build from the checkout instead of pulling: `docker compose up -d --build`, or `docker build -t mason .`.

The image runs gunicorn with one process and many threads, which keeps each user's API cache in one place.
It runs as an unprivileged user (uid 10001) and keeps its data (SQLite by default, the secret key) in `/data`.
In production use the image: `docker build -t mason .`, or `deploy/docker-compose.yml`
(Mason + Postgres on `127.0.0.1:8080`; copy `deploy/mason.env.example` to `deploy/mason.env`). Put it behind a TLS
proxy and set `MASON_TRUSTED_PROXIES=1` so it sees the real client address. The image runs
gunicorn with one process and many threads, which keeps each user's API cache in one place.

## Signing in

GitHub sign-in works out of the box: Mason ships the client ID of its own GitHub OAuth app
(`Ov23liFJgLtIjB3ZtuOy`; a client ID is public) and signs in with GitHub's device flow, which needs no
client secret. The login page shows a code and a link to <https://github.com/login/device>; once you have
entered the code there, the page signs you in by itself. `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` uses your own OAuth app
instead (switch on "Enable Device Flow" in its settings).

With a client secret as well (`GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, or `GITLAB_CLIENT_ID` and
`GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET`) the sign-in is the usual redirect: the authorization code flow with PKCE, back to
`{MASON_URL}/api/v1/auth/{github|gitlab}/callback`. With Mason's own GitHub app, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
alone is enough (its callback URL must match `MASON_URL`). The login page picks the method by itself: the
redirect when there is a secret, else the device flow. GitLab always needs its own app. Mason's own
device-code flow for `mason login` is separate (see [The CLI and TUI through
Mason](#the-cli-and-tui-through-mason)). Someone signed in with one provider connects the other in
Settings › Accounts, and both logins then belong to the same Mason user.

Anyone with a GitHub or GitLab account may sign in, and each user sees only their own repos (through
their own token), API keys, sessions, secrets and audit log. `MASON_ALLOW_USERS` and `MASON_ALLOW_ORGS`
restrict who may sign in.

Every setting belongs to one user: the defaults repo and the repos to manage (with the groups, rules and
templates kept in that defaults repo), the theme, which plugins are on, plugin secrets, API keys and
sessions. No user can read or change another user's, operators included.

### Operators

Operators look after the whole server in the web app's **operator** page: the accounts (logins, keys,
sessions, last sign-in), the server's numbers and problems, plugins switched off for everyone, and
signing a user out everywhere (their sessions end and their keys are revoked; the account stays). Every
change there is in the operator's audit log. The page needs a browser session; API keys never reach it.

Only whoever runs Mason makes someone an operator, with the database on that machine; the web app and the
API can't. The user signs in once first, so their account exists:

```sh
mason operator add github:mike --note "runs it"   # or gitlab:LOGIN, a bare login, or #ID
mason operator list
mason operator remove github:mike                 # from their next request
docker compose run --rm mason mason operator add github:mike   # with the compose file
```

Operators keep signing in when the allow lists change. Other server-wide things stay on the host:

- who may sign in and the limits: the environment below (logins in `MASON_ALLOW_USERS` always get an
  account, so the caps never lock out whoever runs Mason);
- which plugins exist: `pip install` (or `mason market install NAME`) and a restart; `MASON_PLUGINS_OFF`
  keeps one from loading at all;
- `mason serve --users` lists the accounts on the host too.

## OAuth apps

| provider | where | callback URL | scopes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub | Settings › Developer settings › OAuth Apps | `{MASON_URL}/api/v1/auth/github/callback` | `repo read:org workflow security_events read:packages` |
| GitLab | Preferences (or Admin) › Applications, confidential | `{MASON_URL}/api/v1/auth/gitlab/callback` | `api` |

GitHub Enterprise: set `GITHUB_URL` (and `GITHUB_API_URL` if it isn't `{GITHUB_URL}/api/v3`). Self-managed
GitLab: set `GITLAB_URL`.

## Settings (environment)

| variable | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `MASON_URL` | where people reach it (default `http://localhost:8080`, or the port from `mason serve --port`); it must match the OAuth apps' callback URLs, port included; plain `http://` only for localhost, private addresses and `.local`, `.lan` or `.home.arpa` names, `https://` everywhere else |
| `MASON_SECRET_KEY` | encrypts stored tokens and secrets; when unset, Mason makes a random one on first run in `MASON_DATA/secret.key` (mode 0600) and keeps it. Never commit it; `data/` is gitignored. Changing it makes stored tokens unreadable, so users sign in again |
| `MASON_DATA` | data folder (default `./data`, `/data` in the image) |
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLAlchemy URL; SQLite in the data folder by default, `postgresql+psycopg://…` with `[postgres]` |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GITHUB_URL`, `GITHUB_API_URL`, `GITHUB_SCOPES` | the GitHub login: the client ID defaults to Mason's own app (device flow) on github.com; with a secret, the redirect sign-in (scopes default to the table above) |
| `GITLAB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GITLAB_URL`, `GITLAB_SCOPES` | the GitLab login |
| `MASON_ALLOW_USERS` | optional: only these may sign in: `github:mike, gitlab:ann`, or a bare login for either; they always get an account, whatever the caps |
| `MASON_ALLOW_ORGS` | optional: only members of these GitHub orgs or GitLab groups may sign in |
| `MASON_IDLE_HOURS`, `MASON_SESSION_DAYS` | session idle timeout (12) and lifetime (7) |
| `MASON_CACHE` | the base time GitHub and GitLab answers are kept per user (`60s`, `0` to always ask); see [Caching](#caching) |
| `MASON_CACHE_SIZE`, `MASON_CACHE_USER_SIZE` | memory for cached answers, all users together (`256MB`) and one user's share (`32MB`) |
| `MASON_PLUGINS`, `MASON_PLUGINS_OFF` | which installed plugins load: only these (`none` for none), and never these (operators can also switch one off for everyone in the operator page) |
| `MASON_PLUGIN_INDEX`, `MASON_PLUGIN_INDEX_KEYS` | the plugin index (URL or file; default: `plugins/index.json` on this repo's main branch) and extra public keys (base64, comma separated) it may be signed with |
| `MASON_TRUSTED_PROXIES` | how many proxies in front set `X-Forwarded-*` (0) |
| `MASON_AUDIT_DAYS`, `MASON_AUDIT_ROWS`, `MASON_AUDIT_OUTPUT` | audit rows go after 90 days; each user keeps the newest 1000; command output is cut to 1000 characters |
| `MASON_RATE_API`, `MASON_RATE_WRITES`, `MASON_RATE_ANON` | API calls per minute: per user (600), changes per user (60), signed-out calls per address (120); 0 switches one off. Reads through the GitHub proxy for the CLI aren't counted (they spend only your own GitHub quota) |
| `MASON_SIGNUPS_PER_HOUR`, `MASON_SIGNUPS_PER_IP`, `MASON_MAX_USERS` | new accounts per hour in all (60) and per address (5), and the most accounts this Mason takes (1000; 0 = no cap); logins in `MASON_ALLOW_USERS` always get in |
| `MASON_MAX_KEYS`, `MASON_MAX_SESSIONS` | working API keys (50) and browser sessions (20) per user |
| `MASON_AUDIT_IPS` | what the audit log keeps of the caller's address: `hash` (default: an HMAC with the secret key, so "same address" shows without the address), `none`, or `full` |

Over http the session cookie loses its `__Host-` prefix. Mason refuses to start when no login is
configured (GitHub Enterprise without `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, say) or the URL is plain http on a public name.

## Caching

Mason keeps GitHub and GitLab answers in memory only, never on disk, and each user's in their own
cache: nothing one user fetched is ever looked up for another.

- **Per resource**: PRs, merge requests, issues, CI runs, checks and pipelines (and GraphQL) are kept 30s
  at most; files, labels, rulesets and other repo settings for `MASON_CACHE`; the account, its orgs and
  repo metadata 5x as long. `/rate_limit` and job logs are never served from the cache.
- **Conditional requests**: an answer past its time is asked for again with its `ETag` (or `Last-Modified`).
  An unchanged answer comes back as 304, which costs no rate limit on GitHub.
- **Writes**: a change made through Mason (the web app, the console, or the CLI through the operator's
  proxy) makes that repo's answers stale at once, and a GraphQL mutation all GraphQL answers. A change to a
  repo itself drops the repo lists, a file change the loaded `mason.toml` (and any org `.mason` read).
- **Rate limits**: Mason reads GitHub's `X-RateLimit-*` (per bucket: REST, GraphQL, search) and GitLab's
  `RateLimit-*` headers. Under 5% left, answers are kept 4x as long. At 0, or after a `Retry-After`,
  Mason answers from the cache, even stale, and refuses new calls until the reset without asking.
- **Reload**: `r` in the web UI (`?fresh=1` on any read) marks your answers stale, so they are asked for
  again with their ETags; the browser also reuses a tab's last answer for a minute when you switch back.
- **Bounded**: the least recently used answers go first when a user's share or the total is full.
  `/api/v1/rate` shows each user's hits, 304s, entries and bytes; `POST /api/v1/cache/clear` empties it.

## Security model

- **Sign-in**: OAuth authorization code with PKCE (S256) and a `state` bound to the browser by a short-lived
  cookie, or GitHub's device flow, where GitHub's device code stays on the server and the browser holds
  only an HttpOnly cookie for that one sign-in. With allow lists, only allowed accounts get in; the
  decision is made at every sign-in, not once.
- **The user's own token, always.** Every GitHub and GitLab call is made with the signed-in user's token, so
  nobody sees or changes more than their account may. The server never falls back to a token or gh login of
  its own. Tokens are encrypted at rest (Fernet) and refreshed when they expire (GitLab).
- **Revoking tokens.** When someone disconnects a login or deletes their account, Mason deletes its copy of
  the token and asks the provider to revoke it. Both GitHub's and GitLab's revoke APIs need the OAuth app's
  client secret, so this works only with `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` (GitHub) and always for GitLab, which
  needs its secret anyway. With the built-in GitHub sign-in (device flow, no secret) Mason **cannot**
  revoke the token: the UI then shows the link to the app's page at GitHub
  (`https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/<client id>`), where one click revokes it, and the
  audit log records that it wasn't revoked. A failed revoke call is handled the same way.
- **Sessions** are random cookies (`__Host-` prefixed, `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`); the database
  keeps only their SHA-256. Idle and absolute timeouts; users see and end their other sessions.
- **CSRF**: every change needs the session's `X-CSRF-Token` header and a matching `Origin`.
- **API keys** (`mason_<id>_<secret>`) are stored hashed, have a scope (`read` or `write`), an optional expiry,
  and show their last use. Read keys can still ask for dry runs. Creating keys, deleting the account and
  installing plugins need a browser session, not a key.
- **Device login** (`mason login URL`): the terminal shows a code, the user approves it in the browser and picks
  the scope; the terminal gets a key. Codes expire after 10 minutes and polling is rate limited.
- **The GitHub proxy** for signed-in CLIs passes on only the reads mason makes and the writes mason and its plugins
  make; deleting repos, changing access, keys, hooks and account settings are never passed on.
- **Audit log**: sign-ins, keys, every change (with its output) and every dry run, with who and how. It stays
  bounded: the caller's address is kept only as a keyed hash (`MASON_AUDIT_IPS`), output is cut to
  `MASON_AUDIT_OUTPUT` characters, each user keeps at most `MASON_AUDIT_ROWS` rows, rows go after
  `MASON_AUDIT_DAYS`, and deleting an account deletes its rows (one row without name or address records the
  deletion). Expired sessions, sign-in states, device codes and keys revoked or expired over 30 days ago are
  deleted every few minutes.
- **Browser hardening**: a strict CSP (`self` only, no inline scripts or styles, no `data:` fonts), no
  `v-html` anywhere in the UI, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `no-referrer`, HSTS, `Cache-Control: no-store` on the API.
- **Throttling and caps** so open sign-in can't fill the disk: sign-ins, device codes, code lookups and bad
  keys are throttled per address; API calls per user (and per address when signed out); new accounts per
  hour, per address and in all (`MASON_MAX_USERS`; logins in `MASON_ALLOW_USERS` always get one); and what each user stores is capped
  (below). Counters live in memory, so they start over on restart, and each
  server process counts on its own (the image runs one).

  | Per user | Cap |
  |---|---|
  | API keys | `MASON_MAX_KEYS` (50) working keys; revoked or expired ones are deleted after 30 days or beyond twice that number |
  | sessions | `MASON_MAX_SESSIONS` (20); the oldest ends when a new one starts |
  | settings | 32 KB |
  | secrets | one per name a plugin declares, 4000 characters each |
  | audit log | `MASON_AUDIT_ROWS` (1000) rows of at most ~1.5 KB |

  So one account takes at most about 2 MB, and the database at most about `MASON_MAX_USERS` × 2 MB (2 GB with
  the defaults) plus one shared audit budget for failed sign-ins.

## The CLI and TUI through Mason

```sh
mason login https://mason.mortar.ch        # device login; --read for a read-only key, --key KEY to paste one
mason whoami
mason status                                # every command now goes through Mason
mason tui
mason logout                                # forgets the key here (revoke it in Settings › API keys)
```

`mason login` asks Mason for a code and opens the approval page in the browser (over SSH it prints the
link), where you pick read only or read and change; the terminal then gets the key. The key is kept in `~/.config/mason/operator.json` (0600). `MASON_SERVER` and `MASON_KEY`
do the same for CI; `MASON_SERVER=` (set but empty) goes back to gh without logging out. The defaults repo
and orgs then come from your Mason settings.

## Defaults

The defaults repo is the same `mason.toml` the CLI reads (see the README). The defaults editor shows
its files, validates them as you type, offers templates (groups, rulesets, shared files), copies a live
repo's rulesets into the defaults, and saves through a pull request (or merge request) by default, so changes
to the defaults are reviewed like code. The defaults repo itself can live on GitHub or GitLab.

Groups can now match GitLab projects and carry GitLab settings:

```toml
[[group]]
name = "gitlab-services"
match = { provider = "gitlab", prefix = "svc-" }
files = "files/gitlab"

[group.gitlab]
settings = { only_allow_merge_if_pipeline_succeeds = true, remove_source_branch_after_merge = true }
protected_branches = { main = { push_access_level = 0, merge_access_level = 40 } }  # 0 no one, 30 developers, 40 maintainers
approvals_before_merge = 1
```

GitLab projects are named `gitlab:group/sub/project`. List them in Settings (`GitLab groups`, `GitLab projects`).

A group's `match = { org = ... }` takes GitHub orgs (in any case, like GitHub) and GitLab groups with
their subgroups (`org = "grp"` or `org = "grp/sub"`). The group menu above the lists offers the groups
of your defaults and, below them, every org and GitLab group your repos are in, so a repo that no group
matches can still be picked out. The API takes the same filter as `?group=acme/` or `?group=gitlab:grp/`.

Each org (or GitLab group) can also keep its own defaults in a repo named `.mason` (see the README):
its groups apply to that org's repos instead of your catch-all group, and your own groups with a `match`
go on top. Every matching group stacks (the more specific one wins key by key), and a repo's own
`.mason.toml` has the last word for that repo. Mason reads it with the signed-in user's own token, so a user who can't read an org's
`.mason` doesn't get it, and caches it in that user's cache only. `GET /api/v1/config` lists the
`.mason` repos found for your orgs; `org defaults` in Settings turns them off for you.

### Secrets

A repo's page lists the Actions secrets its defaults name (the repo's and each environment's), set or
missing, and the ones set besides. Typing a value and pressing set sends it once: Mason encrypts it with
the repo's public key (libsodium's sealed box, as GitHub wants) and passes it to GitHub with your token. It
keeps nothing, and the audit log records which secret was set where, never the value. "also in" sends
the same value to more repos. `GET /api/v1/repo/secrets?repo=owner/name` lists them, `POST
/api/v1/repo/secrets` (`repos`, `name`, `env`, `value`, a write key) sets one. The CLI through Mason
encrypts on your side, so the value never reaches Mason at all; the proxy passes secret writes but never

## Plugins and the marketplace

Plugins are the same Python entry points the CLI loads. In Mason they can also add:

- `web_actions()`: buttons with parameters (`write: True` actions ask first, are audited, and honor dry run),
- `web_commands`: commands the console allows,
- `web_secrets()`: per-user secrets (e.g. a Hubra token) that users set in Settings and plugins read with
  `plugins.secret(name)` while serving that user.

Each user switches plugins on or off for themselves; operators can switch one off for everyone (and `MASON_PLUGINS_OFF` keeps one from loading).

The marketplace reads a plugin index (this repo's `plugins/index.json` by default) signed with Ed25519 (`mason market
keygen`, `mason market sign`). Unsigned or wrongly signed indexes are shown but nothing installs from them.
An installed plugin runs inside Mason for every user, so plugins are installed where Mason runs
(`pip install`, or `mason market install NAME`), never from the web; restart Mason afterwards. The signing code is adapted from labdex (relicensed into Mason under MIT by its author).

## API

Everything the UI does is JSON under `/api/v1` and works with an API key (`Authorization: Bearer mason_…`):

`/me`, `/config`, `/repos`, `/repo`, `/status`, `/prs`, `/pr`, `/merge`, `/ready`, `/issues`, `/issue`,
`/runs`, `/run?repo=&id=`, `/run/rerun`, `/events?repo=&kind=repo|pr|issue|release|run`, `/approvals`, `/approve`, `/releases` (GET lists, POST creates), `/tags` (POST pushes a tag only), `/bump`, `/release/version`, `/release?repo=&tag=`, `/releases/jobs`, `/packages`, `/security`, `/doctor`, `/sync`,
`/workflows`, `/workflows/pin`, `/new`, `/metrics?days=`, `/console`, `/defaults…`, `/plugins…`, `/market…`,
`/settings`, `/keys`, `/sessions`, `/secrets`, `/audit`, `/rate` and `/cache/clear`, each only ever about
the caller, and for operators (in the browser) `/operator`, `/operator/plugins/NAME` and
`/operator/users/ID/sign-out`. `/api/v1/health` needs no sign-in. Changes take `"dry_run": true`.
